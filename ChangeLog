	iso8859-1 as hard-coded in the postscript header.

	* Uploaded to launchpad (https://launchpad.net/ical-tcl)

	* Timezone support

	* Enabled "Link" menu items and configurable key bindings (commented

	Blanton patch)

	* Added support for context menus (by Ethan Blanton <elb@elitists.net>)

	* Imported Ubuntu's "alarm-arrow" patch (easier to add an alarm arrow
	on the alarm ruler).

Version 2.2 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

	* Ported to Tcl/Tk 8.0

	* Added option for printing to A4 paper

	* Changed keybindings so that alarms do not disappear when the

Version 2.1 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

	* Updated to work with Tcl7.6/Tk4.2 (also works with Tcl7.5/Tk4.1).
	No longer works with earlier versions of Tcl/Tk.

	* Various bug fixes

	* Fix alarm behavior in the presence of concurrently modified
	calendars

	* Improved completion in the file selector widget

	* Moved to file format version 2.0
	+ More uniform text/include-file encoding.
	+ Still reads and writes old format calendars compatibly.
	+ New calendars are written in the new format, which cannot be read
	by old ical versions.
	+ The recommended way to upgrade to the new calendar format is to
	make sure that all copies of ical at your site are upgraded to the
	new version at the same time. If you miss a few copies, they will
	continue to work fine for any existing calendars, but they will not
	be able to read any brand-new calendars created by the new version
	of ical.

	* Changes in the Tcl interface to Ical. Added command to get an item's
	uid.

	* Renamed the time command to ical_time to avoid conflicting with the
	Tcl time command. This is a potential incompatibility for ical scripts.

	* Better documentation display via the 4.0 text widget improvements

	* Fixed geometry handling for virtual window managers

	* Moved to file format version 2.0
	+ More uniform text/include-file encoding.
	+ Still reads and writes old format calendars compatibly.
	+ New calendars are written in the new format, which cannot be read by
	old ical versions.
	+ The recommended way to upgrade to the new calendar format is to make
	sure that all copies of ical at your site are upgraded to the new
	version at the same time. If you miss a few copies, they will continue
	to work fine for any existing calendars, but they will not be able to
	read any brand-new calendars created by the new version of ical.

	* Allow call to "<item> weekdays" with empty week day list

	* Added rule to build bundle with shared Tcl/Tk libs.

	* Use "-lnsl" if available. (This is useful on Solaris?)

Version 1.9 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

	* Changed default color scheme.

	* Improved handling of appointment text that does not fit in available
	area.

	* Added more kinds of repeating items.

	* Added "Todo" items -- these propagate automatically to today every
	day.

	* Added emacs style editing of items.

	* Added on-line help.

	* Added documentation of some of the internals (see doc/interface.ps).
	This will be useful if you want to customize ical, or if you want to
	write scripts to manipulate ical calendars.

	* Load $ical(library)/site.tcl at startup time if available.

	* Changed the Tcl class system to support single inheritance.

	* Added more hooks (dayview-focus, dayview-unfocus, dayview-set-date,
	alarm-fire)

	* Ical can optionally be built as a single executable that contains
	all required tcl/tk files. This allows people to copy ical binaries
	around from one machine to another without having to install Tcl/Tk,
	or without worrying about the location of ical's ".tcl" files.

	* The ical library directory now includes the version number. Therefore
	different versions of ical will not trounce each other anymore.

	* Changed f2h to look for sed in more directories than just /bin.

	* Made selected item background lighter to have better contrast between
	foreground and background.

	* Add "-lc" flag when using shared linking with g++ on DEC OSF1. This
	prevents an undefined symbol error at run-time.

	* Renamed "Annual" menu entry to "Annually".

	* -geometry option was being ignored.

	* Added "-iconposition" option for placing icon.

	* Removed duplicate definition of dialog_run.

Version 1.9b2 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

	* Fixed bug in "contrib/timeofday.tcl".

	* Fixed bug with Monday-First option in "dg_wdays.tcl".

	* Fixed bug in proc name for "delete-word".

	* Call "wm geometry" within "catch" to handle geometry spec errors.

	* Made default "itemOverflowColor" a little darker so that it
	interacts better with the selected item foreground color.

	* Truncate appointment text so that it fits within the available
	area when the appointment is not selected.

	* Changed colors to use a gray background by default.

	* Load $ical(library)/site.tcl at startup time if available.

Version 1.9b1 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

     * Repeating items
          + Added more ways for monthly repetitions
          + Cleaned up Repeat menu
          + Added dialogs for complex repetitions
          + Item listings now contain more detailed repeating item
            descriptions

     * Added "Todo" items -- these propagate automatically to today every day

     * Added emacs style editing of items.

     * Added on-line help.

     * Overflowed appointment text now has a background.

     * Added documentation of some of the internals (see doc/interface.ps).
       This will be useful if you want to customize ical, or if you want to
       write scripts to manipulate ical calendars.

          * Added contributed script "icaladdlines"

          * Added contributed code "timeofday.tcl"

     * The "pollSeconds" option has been split in two -- "pollSeconds" and
       "saveSeconds". The first option controls the frequency of re-reads.
       The second option controls the frequency of saves. By default
       "pollSeconds" is bigger than "saveSeconds".

     * The file selector was changed to not display ~ files by default. The
       "children" list was also made a little wider.

     * Added more hooks (dayview-focus,
       dayview-unfocus,
       dayview-set-date,
       alarm-fire)

     * Adapted the ruler demo from the Tk demo set for selecting a set of
       alarm times.

     * Added "Delete Selection" menu item.

     * Ical can optionally be built as a single executable that contains all
       required tcl/tk files. This allows people to copy ical binaries around
       from one machine to another without having to install Tcl/Tk, or
       without worrying about the location of ical's ".tcl" files.

     * The ical library directory now includes the version number. Therefore
       different versions of ical will not trounce each other anymore.

     * Lots of internal changes. These will allow easier creation of calendar
       management scripts and ical customizations. Plus some outright bugs
       were fixed. The Tcl code cleanups are:

          * cleaned up menu creation

          * cleaned up dialog code

          * cleaned up key binding mechanism

          * moved most code out of DayView into "actions.tcl".

          * removed obsolete use of "pack"

          * added inheritance support to object system

          * made a subclass of ItemWindow to allow moving/resizing

     * C++ code cleanups

          * C++ code now does permission checking and sets modified flags and
            generates triggers on item/calendar modifications. This
            drastically simplified the tcl code for manipulating calendars
            and items.

          * added routine to collect all non-hidden items

          * Removed calendar slot from items.

          * Removed "length" sub-command for notices.

          * cleaned up date/time parsing code and moved into C++

Bug fixes

     * handle invocations when the HOME environment variable is not set

     * Fix hangup that occurs on repeat_check/yes with fast typing into an
       item

     * Removed memory leaks

     * Do not use "gethostid" unless it really works. (It was causing
       core-dumps on some HP machines.)

     * Supply "gethostname" routine for machines that do not have it.
       (Solaris is the only problem reported to me.)

Version 1.8 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

     * Handle color allocation errors so they don't look like bugs.

     * Handle infrequent Tcl syntax errors after reading a calendar file.

     * Added "item-create" hook that is called on item creation in calendar
       window. Use this to customize the initial state of new items.

     * Allow hilite field to be extensible with more values.

Version 1.8b3 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

     * Added a "catch" in dialog handling code to ignore the frequent grab
       errors.

     * Added hook mechanism --

          * ical-startup

          * ical-exit

          * dayview-startup

          * dayview-close

          * item-create

     * Removed vertical-layout options. It is probably used very rarely and
       is easy to set-up via a hook in ~/.tk/ical/user.tcl.

         append-hook dayview-startup {view} {
             pack .$view.al -side bottom
         }

Version 1.8b2 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

     * The calendar view automatically switches to the next day at midnight.
       (But only if the view is displaying the current date.)

     * Added script "icalexpire" to the contrib directory. This script moves
       expired items from the user's calendar into an archival calendar. Use
       it if ical uses too much memory or takes too much time starting up
       because there are too many expired items in your calendar.

     * Reduced per-item memory requirements.

     * Added date/time/time-range/item parsing routines to library.

     * Added code to import the current selection as a new item. The item
       parsing code is used to guess the date and times for the new item.

     * Added script "icaladd" to the contrib directory. This script reads an
       item from the standard input and adds it to the user's calendar. The
       date and times for the item are extracted from the standard input if
       possible.

Version 1.8b1 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

     * Added highlighting options for items.

     * Changed shut up button to say "No More Alarms"

     * Cleaned up man-page formatting (thanks to john@civil.su.oz.au)

     * Include user name in printouts

     * Changed startup code so that more things get initialized when the ical
       shells start up. Therefore the tcl startup scripts need less junk. It
       also makes it easier to build various converters and other scripts
       that manipulate calendar data.

     * Added a "contrib" directory.

     * Added a script "ical2calendar" to convert from an ical calendar to an
       old-style calendar file.

     * Made "dialog_wdays" obey Monday-first option.

Version 1.7 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

     * Various bug fixes

     * Item text now word-wraps automatically. An unfortunate side-effect of
       this change is that explicit new-lines in old items may make the items
       have excessive new-lines.

     * Notices automatically expand and shrink as the text changes.
       Appointments will optionally not allow text changes that would result
       in overflow.

     * More user preferences can be set while ical is running.

          * default alarm intervals

          * default early-warning behavior

          * the time range displayed in the appointment window

          * height of the notice window

          * width of displayed appointments and notices

          * whether or not appointments allow text overflow

     * Dragging with the left mouse button held down in an appointment or
       notice sets the X selection.

     * The "Insert Selection" entry in the Edit menu can now be used to
       "paste" the current X selection into an appointment or notice. The key
       "^y" invokes this operation.

     * On monochrome displays, item selection is indicated by changing the
       border width of the selected item instead of reversing the colors.
       This change was made because reversed colors interacted badly with
       overflow text and X selections.

     * Added command line options "-fg" and "-bg".

     * The menus have been rearranged a bit.

     * Added a print dialog to control printing.

Version 1.7b1 Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@pa.dec.com>

     * Various bug fixes

     * Support for Tcl 7.0 and Tk 3.3. Ical no longer works with older
       versions of Tcl and Tk

     * Uses GNU style build process. Installers just need to type "configure"
       and "make".

     * Ical is more careful about the fonts it picks. If a required font does
       not exist, it tries to find another similar font. Eventually it falls
       back to "fixed". You can also change from one font family to another
       very easily -- use the "Ical.fontFamily" resource. See the man page
       for more details.

     * Menus behave like most non-motif applications (unless tk_strictMotif
       is set to true). I put in this change because most people in my lab
       hate the motif-style menus that stay popped up even after you release
       the button.

     * Users can now change the interval at which ical polls its calendar
       files. This can help if you are on a slow machine.

     * Added "-popup" option for generating a nice item listing on an X
       display. You can put "ical -popup" in your ".xsession" file and get a
       little item listing window whenever you login.

     * Items now have an "owner" field to indicate who created them.

     * You can interactively change alarms for each appointment.

     * Backspace now deletes the last character (just like the Delete key)

     * If you delete an item you do not own, it does not actually get
       deleted. It just gets hidden from your view.

     * You can now control am/pm printing, and whether a week starts with a
       monday as opposed to a sunday.

     * Support for eight-bit characters.
